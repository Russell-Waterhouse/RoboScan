# RoboScan

## A work in progress
This project is currently under active development, and has not yet reached a first
stable release. 

## About the project
Inspired by GoBuster, RoboScan is a CLI website enumeration tool that uses a 
website's robots.txt as the wordlist.   
Because the robots.txt file is often a list of everything that website's administrator
doesn't want the public internet to know about, a tool that quickly makes 
requests to every listing in robots.txt and tells you which return a 200 OK is 
a useful tool to have. 
This tool is useful to red teams doing security assessments on websites.
